/**
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for a web hosting client area,
 * with a full access override for users with an 'admin' custom claim.
 * Each authenticated user corresponds to a single client document. All associated
 * data (services, domains, invoices, tickets) is strictly segregated and can only be
 * accessed by the authenticated user who owns it, or by an admin. The default
 * security posture is to deny all access, granting permissions explicitly.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * All user-specific data is nested within their own document in the top-level
 * `/clients` collection. For example, a user with UID 'user123' will have their
 * data stored at `/clients/user123`. This path-based structure is the
 * primary mechanism for enforcing ownership for regular users.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Strict User Isolation: A non-admin user can only ever read or write data located under
 *   `/clients/{their_own_uid}`. Cross-user access is impossible for non-admins.
 * - Admin Override: A user with `request.auth.token.admin == true` bypasses
 *   ownership checks and has read/write access to all data for management purposes.
 * - No Public User Listing: To protect user privacy, listing the top-level `/clients`
 *   collection is forbidden for non-admin users, preventing enumeration of the user base.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * This ruleset relies on path-based ownership, where the user's UID is part of the
 * document path (e.g., `/clients/{clientId}`). This is the most performant way to
 * secure subcollections, as it avoids any slow and costly `get()` calls to parent
 * documents for authorization checks.
 *
 * Structural Segregation:
 * Each data type (Services, Domains, Invoices, Tickets) is stored in its own
 * dedicated subcollection under the parent client. This ensures that security rules
 * are simple, targeted, and easy to reason about for each type of data.
